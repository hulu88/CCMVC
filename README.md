The manuscript titled "Deep Contrastive Coordinated Multi-View Consistency Clustering". Please feel free to contact me if you have any prbolem. 

You may reproduce the experimental results presented in the paper if setting the following parameter "load_model" to True. This means that the program will load the trained model provided by the authors for clustering tasks.

parser.add_argument('--load_model', default=False, help='Testing if True or training.')

You may consult the commented code in the file “main.py” for guidance on selecting the proper parameters if the trained model is unavailable for additional datasets.

The network is improved based on CVCL, and the relevant data sets can be downloaded from CVCL.

Thank you.
